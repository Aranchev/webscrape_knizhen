This is a web scraping software that accepts keywords, then enters pre-specified bookstores on the website https://knizhen-pazar.net/ to find the cheapest books matching the keywords. It returns the following information for 10 books (if there are that many) from each bookstore: price, name, and link to the book.

The software requires only the installation of Selenium.
